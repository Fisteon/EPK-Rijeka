# EPK-Rijeka


Game made in Unity for the exhibition in Rijeka, as a part of the European Capital of Culture program. City models were done in Sketchpad, character model and animation, as well as some smaller models were made in Blender, sound and music were implemented using FMOD.

The game showcases the old city core of Rijeka, and is divided in 4 parts/sectors (each sector is set in a different part of the city), the idea being that exhibition visitors play a single sector at a time. Each sector has a different visual and audio theme, and a different playstyle. Video for each sector can be found below
